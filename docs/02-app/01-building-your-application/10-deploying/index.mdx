Congratulations, it's time to ship to production.

You can deploy [managed Next.js with Vercel](#managed-nextjs-with-vercel), or [self-host](/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying/self-hosting) on a Node.js server, Docker image, or even static HTML files. When deploying using `next start`, all Next.js features are supported.

## Production Builds

Running `next build` generates an optimized version of your application for production. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files are created based on your pages. JavaScript is **compiled** and browser bundles are **minified** using the [Next.js Compiler](/docs/architecture/nextjs-compiler) to help achieve the best performance and support [all modern browsers](/docs/architecture/supported-browsers).

Next.js produces a standard deployment output used by managed and self-hosted Next.js. This ensures all features are supported across both methods of deployment. In the next major version, we will be transforming this output into our [Build Output API specification](https://vercel.com/docs/build-output-api/v3?utm_source=next-site&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=next-website).

## Managed Next.js with Vercel

[Vercel](https://vercel.com/docs/frameworks/nextjs?utm_source=next-site&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=next-website), the creators and maintainers of Next.js, provide managed infrastructure and a developer experience platform for your Next.js applications.

Deploying to Vercel is zero-configuration and provides additional enhancements for scalability, availability, and performance globally. However, all Next.js features are still supported when self-hosted.

Learn more about [Next.js on Vercel](https://vercel.com/docs/frameworks/nextjs?utm_source=next-site&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=next-website) or [deploy a template for free](https://vercel.com/templates/next.js?utm_source=next-site&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=next-website) to try it out.
